<p>After a long time of debating with myself, I have finally started a blog on my website! In fact, I started this blog the day after I purchased timothylock.ca to celebrate new beginnings. I was going to start the blog last week but unfortunately I was at McHacks (hackathon in Montreal) and I did not have time to make it.</p>
<p>On that note, I just recently got back from McHacks and I have to say that as my 5th hackathon, it was still an enjoyable one. One thing that was different about McHacks compared to other hackathons such as Hack The North, MHacks, etc is that this one was short. Instead of having 36 hours, we only had 24 hours to make our app. Besides that, the food was excellent, lines (despite being long) moved quickly so you could be at the back of the line and then be at the front for food in less than 5 minutes. The bus ride was long (pickup at UofT at 1am) with its 6 hour bus ride but it was still enjoyable (got a lot of sleep).</p>
<p>In the end, my group and I made a nice app that uses machine learning to predict what products may interest you and links to purchase them off of eBay</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>
