<p>At last, I finally came home from university and I got a chance to look closely at the TVpad. Ever since my parents got it, I was curious on what it ran on (let's face it, a lot of knockoff Chinese media players run android). The website said it was android 4.4 and at that point, I made it my mission to be able to install my own apk files on it.</p>
<p>It wasn't an easy task. The developers made quite the effort to hide the default system UI from the user. At first, I plugged in a mouse and low and behold. Dragging the cursor down from the top of the screen produced the android notification center. From there, I was able to get into the settings screen and see all the goodies. Suprisingly, it seems as if the developers shrunk the top bar into a few pixels height. Clever trick! Unfortunately, I can't install apks from that screen.</p>
<p>So at this point, I was a bit disappointed. A good lead but it got me nowhere. Then I opened up TVpad's internet browser and downloaded ES File Manager apk. Just like that, it installed. Now I was able to look into the system and "unlock" the default apps (dialer, browser, etc). On addition to that, I was able to extract all of their own apps (their TV apps). Going to see if it can run on my other android stick!</p>

<p>UPDATE: Seems like some apps can run and the default TVPad apps throws an error. Maybe they actually check. I'll see
  if I can bypass that</p>
