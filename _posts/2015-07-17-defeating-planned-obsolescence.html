<p>One of the weird things that have been happening over the past few weeks (okay fine - half a year) was that the garage door opener would constantly open halfway or so and then all the power would be cut (and it would stop). I've disregarded it since I could always continue opening it by tapping the machine (and the power would come back) or manually open the door. Today, the machine finally gave out and I decided to take a look at it.</p>
<p>At first, I thought that it was just the trip sensor that was loose, wire was loose, etc. Basically I was hoping that the machine itself wasn't broken. After all of that testing, I concluded that the machine inside was busted. What a bummer. Nobody wants a $300 dead weight.</p>
<p>The electrical engineer inside of me (okay fine I am in computer science but its close enough right?) decided to bust open the machine (after unplugging it of course!) to examine what's wrong. I took out my multimeter and started tracing the power and ground to see where it broke (since I remember that the machine completely lost power rather than parts of it not working). Turns out that the solder on one of the connectors went loose.</p>
<p>All in all, that easy fix costed me absolutely nothing (except for a dab of new solder) and if people knew just to take a look into their broken machines, they can save a lot of money.</p>
