<p>I am proud to say that <a href="https://timothylock.ca">https://timothylock.ca</a> is now live! I have been tinkering around with SSL and this site can now be accessed via HTTPS. It has not been enabled by default but I plan to force all unencrypted traffic through HTTPS soon. That way nobody will find out your guilty pleasure of reading this blog ;)</p>
