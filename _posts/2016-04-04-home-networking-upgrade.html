<p>I can finally announce that all of the internet problems that have been happening at my place has been resolved!</p>
<p>When I first moved into my place downtown, I used a simple router/modem combo that was provided by Rogers - bad idea. It constantly kicked many of my WiFi devices off of the network. To top it off, it would constantly drop the internet and reboot itself halfway through my gaming sessions. Imagine playing League of Legends and having to disconnect for 5 minutes while your modemÂ reboots - not something you want to do.</p>
<p>Today, I finally decided to disable the "residential gateway" function on the modem and just have another router handle the DHCP server and the other functions and to just let my modem ... do what the modem is supposed to do. Today, I am proud to say that not only has my network seen instant improvement - but it also is now at gigabit speeds!</p>
<p>I already have DDWRT running on my new router but I do not plan to run a lot of scripts on it because I believe that the router should be focusing on one thing and one thing only - routing. That is what my Raspberry Pi is for! ;)</p>
