#### Who are you?

I currently work as an associate engineer at [Wattpad](https://company.wattpad.com).

I graduated from the Computer Science program at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca).

I was a programming / robotics instructor at [LogicFusion](https://logicfusion.ca).

I have been a part of [University of Toronto Aerospace Team](https://utat.ca) and recently as a division lead for over 3 years.

I have worked on many quirky projects including a [inventory system](/portfolio) and a [pancake printer](/portfolio).    

#### Examples or it didn't happen
I write [code](https://github.com/timothylock) and some [idiotic comments](https://www.twitter.com/timothyklock) about things I see.

I hear people telling me to blog it instead. [Done](/blog).

I made some cool [projects](/portfolio) as well.

I have a [résumé](timothy_lock_resume.pdf) if you're into that sort of thing.
