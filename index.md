# Welcome

## Who are you?
I am enrolled in the Computer Science program at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca).

I am currently working as an associate engineer at [Wattpad](https://company.wattpad.com).

I am also a programming / robotics instructor at [LogicFusion](https://logicfusion.ca).

I have been a part of [University of Toronto Aerospace Team](https://utat.ca) and recently as a division lead for over 3 years.

I have worked on many quirky hardware projects including a pancake printer and a WiiU controlled drone.

## Examples or it didn't happen
I write code and some idiotic comments about things I see.

I sometimes write [longer idiotic comments](/blog) too.

I made some cool projects as well.

I have a résumé if you're into that sort of thing.
