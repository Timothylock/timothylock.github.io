      <p>If you have been following with my recent home automation adventures, you would realize that I essentially automated
    everything through relays connected to my Raspberry Pi using the CAT5 cables in the wall as wiring to control other
    parts of my home. Frankly, it was very hacky, messy, and hard to maintain. Any new feature I wanted required me to
    code something new into the codebase and automation became a matter of hard-coding. It was simply not sustainable
    and required too much maintenance.</p>
<p>Lucky for me, Black Friday came along and with those came the sales. As home automation becomes more mainstream, the
    prices go down. In fact, Google went crazy running promotions for their Google Home platform here in Toronto for the
    past few months (making Alexa's debut in Canada just wash out in the noise). I managed to pick myself up some nice
    things including a few <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/us/products/details/cat-5516_HS105.html">TPLink Smart WiFi
        Plug minis</a>, <a href="http://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F7C030/">Wemo Smart Light Switches</a>, a <a
            href="https://store.google.com/product/google_home_mini">Google Home Mini</a>, and a <a
            href="https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_2015">Google Chromecast</a>. The reason I chose these
    specific smart devices was that I knew they connect to WiFi (without requiring a proprietary bridge) and that they
    have documented/undocumented APIs that you can use to locally control them. They also play nice with Google Home so
    if I was ever to get rid of my Pi Home Automation, they would still have a use (outside of their own apps).</p>
<p>So here we are... we have all these new devices that somehow needs to get integrated into the home assistant.
    Wouldn't it be cool of it could just detect these devices? How much coding would this take? Is it even worth it?
    Patience and food supplies were running low at this point. All hope was getting lost..... then came <a
            href="https://home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>! It turns out that a bunch of people already created an
    open-source platform which basically did what I done before - plus a lot more.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/images/blog_legacy_wordpress/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-07-at-4.06.36-PM.png"><img
        class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2954"

        alt=""/></a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform worked really well, discovering all of my smart home devices as well as android webcams with little
    configuration required. To top it off, it still allowed me to use my GPIO pins (my DIY switches) as well as my door
    sensors. A little bonus is that it discovered my Chromecast and Google Home out of the box with the ability to see
    what is playing, send text for them to speak, and even control the media that is playing on it.</p>
<p>I'm very excited to work with this platform and to take it to its limit. Once I get used to the platform code, I hope
    to be able to contribute back to this project soon! Let's see how it goes.</p>
