<p>So a power outage recently happened at my condo. As of the typing of this post, it is actually still happening. With that being said, there is currently no power to any of my equipment (and that includes my WiFi router as well as my modem. Refusing to use up my precious data (its pretty expensive up here in Canada), I decided to investigate what input voltages and currents the internet equipment required.</p>
<p>To my surprise, they both took 12V with a combined max current of 3A. That was good as I just happened to have two 3S lipo batteries lying around that were capable of outputting 12V at 45A. Hooked them up to the modem and router and everything fired up!</p>
<p>I'm actually typing this post during the power outage using the battery-powered wifi + modem!</p>
