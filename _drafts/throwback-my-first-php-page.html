<p>My very first PHP page was back in high school when I wanted a fast and small website that I could use to check bus times (because back then my phone was questionably slow).</p>
<p>Calling it NextVehicle, I set out to create a page that would query an API to provide live bus information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uploaded a copy onto my site and it can be found here: <a href="https://timothylock.ca/nextvehicle/">https://timothylock.ca/nextvehicle/</a></p>
